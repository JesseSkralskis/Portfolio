  description: `One of my clients is a math tutor and he wanted me to build a site where he could advertise his tutoring as well as have a place for his students to pay online for his tutoring. He also wanted to be able to change some of the content without having to call me everytime to make the changes. I decided to build his site using the JAM stack because of its fast loading times and ability for the user to use the Contentful CMS to make changes. For payment I implemented the Stripe API and set up 4 different payment packages based on amount of tutoring sessions bought at once. `,
