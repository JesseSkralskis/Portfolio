              I have a client who has a math tutoring business. Most of his
              students would come from word of mouth, but he wanted to expand
              his business and create a web site that would attract more
              students. He wanted to be able to change content but has no coding
              experience. He also wanted a booking system that would allow users
              to book appointments from the web site and send him an email
              notification when the appointment was booked, I did some research
              on the best way to tackle this job and decided to build his site
              using the JAM stack. I used contentful as the cms Gatsby for
              building the site and Netlify to deploy the site. I also used Web
              hooks within Netlify and Contentful that allowed when my client
              changes content within Contentful it automatically rebuilds the
              repository rebuilds and then deploys in Netlify. The site consists
              of the Landing page with a nav bar to the different pages of the
              site. The slogan within the card was decided on by the client who
              also had input on the color palette. The background picture and
              the slogan header and paragraph below can all be changed very
              simply within the Contentful cms whenever the client decides by
              just dragging and dropping photos or editing the text. The about
              me page gives information about my clients credentials and tells
              the story of why students should choose him as their math tutor.
              Again the text and the phota can be changed at any time by my
              client within Contentful. The client wanted to add a page that
              displayed all of the different services he offered. Me and him
              discussed how he wanted the offerings to be listed and appear on
              the page as well as the photo. And He was happy to have the
              flexibility to also be able to change this as needed without
              having to pay me an updating fee. The Client was very specific
              about how he wanted the booking system to work. It had to be a
              system that allowed him to designate open times for tutoring that
              when filled would then be rendered unavailable to other students
              once booked. He also wanted his students to have the ability to
              use Paypal for payments. After considering building this
              functionality myself I did some research and found a very useful
              plugin called Calendry. For a small fee all the functionality the
              client requested was already included in Calendry’s features. I
              just needed to embed the interface directly into the site and the
              plugin would take care of the rest. My client was very happy with
              this option because the price for me to build an entire booking
              system in his site would have been quite a bit more than the small
              monthly fee from Calendry. The photo in this page can also be
              changed automatically from the Contentful cms.

              Technology
              <br />
              <br />
              This project required me learning and implementing many different
              technologies. The biggest two were learning Gatsby and learning
              GraphQl. Furthermore I needed to learn how to set up the
              Contentful cms for the client and teach him what he would need to
              do when he needed to change content. I have a background in React
              so learning Gatsby was very intuitive and I ended up really
              appreciating the workflow that it offered. I had heard so much
              about how great the Jam Stack was and how Gatsby optimised loading
              times and I wasn't disappointed. I also really enjoyed learning
              graphQl and saw first hand the benefit of being able to be
              selective of what I pull from APIs rather than the old restful
              approach. In general most of the pages had the same flow. Through
              a Gatsby config file I set up a Gatsby-Contentful plugin that
              through a space id and an access token allows Gatsby to have
              access to the content within Contentful. For each Page I would
              make a graphQl query requesting the given content using its
              specific slug. Also within the query I could set parameters for
              the images using another Gatsby Plugin called Gatsby-Sharp. This
              allows for photo optimization as well as adding effects, and
              dictating size. I would then take the response from the GraphQl
              query and distribute it within the page using the jsx. For
              Navigation between pages gatsby has built in Link plugins almost
              identical to using React Router. It was as simple as wrapping some
              h1’s in With a link Component and assigning the to=”/” to whatever
              the name of the page was.

              New Features
              <br />
              <br />
              As of writing this I have been in discussions with my client about
              adding new features. He decided he wants more diversity in payment
              options within the site. So I am now adding in the Stripe api
              which allows for many different options for payment and is also
              very secure. I have created the 4 tutoring packages with the
              prices attached within the Stripe account and have set up the
              configuration that allows Gatsby and Stripe to connect. I have
              built the component buttons that when clicked allow his students
              to be redirected directly to a stripe page with the chosen
              product. I am currently designing the payment page and will be
              implementing and deploying it soon. My client also wants to
              transition his business to more virtual sessions because of the
              new coronavirus environment we are all living in now. So for this
              I will be adding a page that is a dedicated zoom room where the
              user will be able to from the site be able to click a button and
              be able to connect with my Client to start a session virtually.

              A math tutoring site built using JAM stack. The client needed a
              way to change content without dependence on coding knowledge. This
              was achieved using Contenful cms in conjunction with Gatsby and
              Netlify.
